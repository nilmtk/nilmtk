          someone staying at the house who occassionally swapped the toaster and kettle
          around (i.e. the toaster was plugged into the kettle sensor and visa-versa!)
          and also appeared to plug the hoover sensor into the kettle sensor (i.e.
          both the hoover and kettle sensor would have recorded the same appliance
          for a few hours).
